For now the program only displays a sphere i hardcoded in the center, launch program with ./rtv1 any_file, its not doing anything with the file yet.

- Write parser that takes data on objects in scene, and stores it in memory (probably linked list)
for now just a sphere and a plane would be nice, afterwards a cylinder and cone

- Write a parser that stores data from the input file in t_rt struct and t_obj linked list. input file example is in 'template' 
file. You can start this if you want. you still need to make a t_obj struct that can contain all the relevant data for the 
objects from the template, but you can start with parsing the camera position and direction.

- Functions to calculate intersection for the different shapes, sphere one is already started, but needs to be norme, i can do these.

- Makefile that puts all object files for src/*.c files in obj/*.o

- illumination and shading

- being able to parse and alter camera angle, position and direction

- Remove the allocating part of the struct in demo.c (change it to a simple varaible)

- Silence some warnings (errors?) in demo.c as well
